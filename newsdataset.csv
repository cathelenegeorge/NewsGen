A highly placed source said that the central government has approved a proposal for establishing the setup that will be known as the Border Intelligence Post (BIP).


The move bears significance in view of the increased Chinese activities along the border and transgressions by China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA).

A stand-off between the Indian Army and the PLA in Ladakh has been going on since June 2020.

Each of the BIPs will be manned by four-five officials of the Intelligence Bureau and protected by ITBP personnel, the source in the know of the development said on the condition of anonymity.

The personnel who will be deployed at the BIPs will keep an eye on activities across the border and share updates with the higher authorities and the government.

The source, however, refused to disclose the amount sanctioned by the central government for the project, citing its sensitive nature.

Mago is the first village close to the border with China in the Chuna sector in Arunachal’s Tawang district.

An all-terrain motorable road was built in the village only in 2020.

There are around 180 border outposts of the ITBP along the entire India-China border, and the establishment of 45 more was sanctioned recently.


Twenty Army soldiers were killed in a clash with the PLA in June 2020 in Ladakh’s Galwan valley.

On 9 December last year, PLA troops intruded in Yangste in Arunachal, which led to a clash between the soldiers of the neighbouring countries and resulted in injuries to both sides.

Since the India-China border is not fully demarcated, both sides have different perceptions of the line of actual control (LAC). There have been reports of PLA troops often transgressing the disputed areas.

Speaking at a function here on Monday, union minister Kiren Rijiju said that a country is safe when its borders are safe.

“Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, not a single village is left where vehicles can’t reach. These border villages were neglected earlier. I also assure you that in the next six months, all border villages in Arunachal Pradesh will have 5G mobile phone connectivity,” said Rijiju, who represents the Arunachal West constituency in the Lok Sabha.

In the last few years, the central government has not only ramped up its infrastructure at the LAC but also introduced schemes for the development of border villages.

Among these is the Vibrant Villages Programme (VVP), under which all-round development of select frontier villages is carried out.


“The highest number of villages among all states will be developed in Arunachal Pradesh under the VVP. Out of the 665 villages selected under the VVP, 453 are in Arunachal in first phase,” Chief Minister Pema Khandu said at the function. (PTI)","
The Indian government has approved a Border Intelligence Post (BIP) setup along the India-China border, from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh, to enhance surveillance due to increased Chinese activity. Each BIP will include Intelligence Bureau officers and be guarded by the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP). This comes amid ongoing tensions with China since the 2020 Ladakh standoff. Union Minister Kiren Rijiju also highlighted infrastructure improvements, including the Vibrant Villages Programme (VVP) and upcoming 5G mobile connectivity for border villages in Arunachal Pradesh.",National News

The accused was found guilty of committing the offence of penetrative sexual assault on his stepdaughter, and has been sentenced under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) and the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Earlier, on 23 March, 2022, the Jenging police station received a written complaint from the district child protection unit to the effect that Apang, who had sexually assaulted his minor stepdaughter in 2019 and was out on bail, reportedly committed the same offence on his stepdaughter, who was about 13 years old.

Following this, a case [u/s 376 (2) (F) (n) IPC r/w 6/16 of POCSO Act] was registered.

The child had been staying with Apang since she was about 11 years old, after her mother, who works at a tea garden in Ramsing, married Apang. He started sexually abusing the child immediately after the marriage and ultimately impregnated her.

The incident came to light when the child’s aunt found out that she was pregnant and brought her to Yingkiong for medical examination. Subsequently, an FIR was lodged against the convict and he was arrested and later enlarged on bail.

But after his release from jail, Apang returned, stayed with the child and her mother, committed sexual assault on the minor, and impregnated her again.

While sentencing, the special judge said, “The convict has shown no remorse for his action and he has utter disregard for law and order, and, despite being enlarged on bail, committed the same offence twice.”

The special judge therefore pronounced a double sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment for the first offence, and life imprisonment for the subsequent offence. (DIPRO)","Kalen Apang, 33, from East Siang district, India, was sentenced to 20 years and life imprisonment for sexually assaulting and impregnating his minor stepdaughter twice.

Some victims also do not want to shift to the temporary accommodation that the government has offered, saying that they will never be able to return to their homes if they move to these new prefabricated dwelling units.

At the Thongju Kendra Relief Camp set up at Ideal Girls College in Akampat of Imphal East district, some inmates from Tengnoupal and Churachandpur districts told PTI that they “do not have faith in the state government’s assurance on rebuilding their homes.”

“It has been more than three months we are living in relief camps. How long are we going to stay here? We need our home back. Our people were murdered, now we need justice,” said Sanatambi, who hails from the India-Myanmar border town of Moreh.

Nganthoibi (24) and her family from Churachandpur also want to go back to their home now as they do not want to stay at the relief camp in “inhuman conditions.”

“I have a six-member family — husband, 7-month-old baby, father-in-law, mother-in-law and sister-in-law — all are here in the relief camp. On May 3, our house was burnt and we could collect nothing while fleeing from the place. We have lost everything in this clash,” she told PTI over the phone.

She claimed that many inmates in the relief camp are willing to move to the temporary houses that the government has constructed at different locations despite assurances from the administration of shifting them to their respective homes in future when the situation normalises.

“We don’t trust the government, we don’t know for how long it will be in those temporary locations. We want to go back to our own houses. We are tired of the government’s assurances and don’t see any hope from them,” Nganthoibi said.

“We want to go back to Moreh to our homes. This town was the No. 2 in revenue collection for Manipur after Imphal. If this violence continues, India is going to lose heavily. The BJP is responsible for the situation that Manipur is witnessing today. In the case of Moreh, there has been no town committee election for the last 10 years. All the Marwaris and Punjabis have fled the town, and the Tamilian people left after this present violence began,” Ingobi Singh (75) from Moreh said.

Moreh, one of the fastest growing towns in Manipur, in Tengnoupal district, is predominantly a Kuki town with a sizeable number of Tamils and other communities like Punjabis. It’s a multi-religious town with Christians being the majority, followed by Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains.

“How long are we going to suffer like this? We appeal to the government to bring peace as soon as possible. We want to go back to our homes at Churachandpur,” said Rajen Huiram (37) from the hill district.

On August 23, Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh had said that the prefabricated houses built for those affected by violence are not a permanent arrangement and were constructed to ease the hardship faced by those living in relief camps.

He had handed over the temporary shelter homes to over 300 families at Sajiwa Jail Complex in Imphal East district. The victims were staying at various relief camps in the same area.

The prefabricated houses, being built at eight sites, are ready-made structures that are constructed off-site and assembled at the place where the homes will be set up.

Singh had said that 320 houses have been built at Kwakta in Bishnupur district, 400 at Sajiwa and 200 at Sawombung in Imphal East, while 400 such houses were constructed at Yaithibi Loukol in Thoubal district.

The chief minister had also said there would be a little delay in Kangpokpi and Churachandpur districts.

Two sites have been considered for 700 families in Kangpokpi district. For Churachandpur too, a site for construction is identified, he had added.

More than 160 people lost their lives and several hundreds were injured since ethnic clashes broke out in Manipur on May 3, after a ‘Tribal Solidarity March’ was organized in the hill districts to protest against the Meitei community’s demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status.

Meiteis account for about 53 per cent of Manipur’s population and live mostly in the Imphal Valley. Tribals — Nagas and Kukis — constitute little over 40 per cent and reside in the hill districts. (PTI)","Victims of ethnic strife in Manipur, housed in makeshift relief camps for over three months, are urging the state government to resolve the conflict so they can return home. Many are skeptical of the government’s temporary accommodation solutions and prefer returning to their original homes. Some, like Nganthoibi from Churachandpur, are living in poor conditions and have lost everything during the violence. Moreh town, a significant revenue contributor to Manipur, has been severely affected, with many communities fleeing due to the unrest. Over 160 people have died since the clashes began in May 2023, following protests against the Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe status.",National News

The yatra will reach Arunachal on Saturday afternoon from Lakhimpur in neighbouring Assam.

“Become a ‘nyay yodha’ and carry the message of love and harmony and awaken the nation’s conscience to crippling inequality, brutal social polarisation and violent authoritaria-nism. Let’s walk together to fight hatred and fear!” said Tuki, a former chief minister.


He alleged that the last 10 years of “grave injustice” by the BJP government has severely hurt people, democracy and the Constitution.

“Unprecedented unemployment has shattered the dreams and future of our youth,” he said, claiming that poor and middle-class people lost their savings due to the price rise.

“Income inequality is at its peak,” Tuki alleged in a statement.

While the SCs, STs, OBCs, minorities and poor people have been deceived, autonomous institutions have been subjugated, the Congress leader claimed.

Central agencies such as the ED, the CBI, and the income tax department are being used against the opposition, Tuki alleged.

Gandhi along with party leaders and workers will arrive at Doimukh in Papum Pare district from Lakhimpur at around 2 pm on Saturday, and will interact with the public at the SDO ground.

From Doimukh, Gandhi is scheduled to reach Naharlagun by bus and interact with the street vendors at 6 Km, sources said.

The Congress leader would then move towards Nyokum Lapang, from where he would embark on a foot march to Malo Tarin Govt Higher Secondary School ground to address a public rally.


Gandhi would also address a press conference in Itanagar on the same day.

“We want the Centre to tell us about the way forward. Otherwise, we will be groping in dark,” said the bench comprising Chief Justice DY Chandrachud and Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra.

The top court also sought to know from the Centre as to whether there is any data based on scientific studies that these birds die of collision with the “overhead power transmission line.”

“Do we have any authentic data from a government-monitored study on the efficacy of the bird diverters in saving the GIBs from collision-related deaths?” the CJI asked, adding that now the Centre will have to decide the way forward as the apex court has already come out with its judgment.

“I am not sanguine about the bird diverters. What is the data with the Centre on the efficacy of bird diverters? We are asking the AG (attorney general) about the way forward. Tell us what can be done,” the bench observed.

“Let the government just tell us about the way forward. Let a comprehensive status report be filed, showing both the need for preservation of GIB and also the need of the solar power plants operating keeping in mind India’s commitment at the international level,” the bench said.

It referred to twin rival aspects of the matter, saying that one pertains to saving these birds and the other is related to setting up solar power plants which can be set up in states like Rajasthan and Gujarat, the key habitats of this endangered species.

The bench asked the Centre to file a comprehensive status report dealing with the twin aspects of the matter and the way forward, and fixed the PIL for further hearing on 9 February. The government has been asked to share the report with the parties concerned three days before the next date of hearing.

 The bench took note of the submissions of senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for PIL petitioner MK Ranjitsinh and others, that the great Indian bustard is on the verge of extinction and the court’s 2021 judgment has not been complied with.

Besides seeking a status report from a court-appointed expert committee, the bench also directed the chief secretaries of Rajasthan and Gujarat to file the latest report on the steps taken in the case. The CJI asked Attorney General R Venkataramani to take personal efforts in getting the issues resolved.

The top court in its 2021 judgment on the PIL had passed a slew of directions to save the great Indian bustard. It had earlier directed the governments of Gujarat and Rajasthan to replace overhead electric cables with underground power cables, wherever feasible, and install bird diverters in priority areas where the birds live.

It had also set up a three-member committee, comprising scientists Rahul Rawat, Sutirtha Dutta and Devesh Gadhavi, to assess the feasibility for laying of high-voltage underground power lines. However, the experts and others objected to the underground laying of high-power transmission lines on the grounds of its feasibility.

It had also sought reports from the chief secretaries of Rajasthan and Gujarat on installation of bird diverters in priority areas and assess the total length of transmission lines in the two states where under-grounding of electric wires have to be done to ensure the birds do not die of electrocution.

The PIL has sought the court’s directions for an urgent emergency response plan to protect and ensure the recovery of the numbers of the endangered great Indian bustard and the lesser florican.

The project will cover 175 households of Niausa village.

Addressing the gathering, Wangnaw commended “the efforts of the PHE department towards addressing the issue of water scarcity.”

He said that the inauguration of the water supply project was “one of the cherished dreams of the villagers, which was long overdue.”

“The present government is endeavouring hard and is committed to ensure that the issue of water scarcity in the district is resolved soon,” Wangnaw said.

DC Bani Lego said that, “with the inauguration of the project, it will not just add to the convenience of the people but also lead to saving of time, and thereby will have a multiplier effect in the development process of the area.”


He added that such developmental activities and initiatives should be appreciated and celebrated by all.

“Entire Niausa village will be covered under the JJM scheme in a phase-wise manner,” he added.

PHED EE Tage Nipa informed that “it was a humongous task as the length of the pumping main is 2.10 kilometres and the water had to be lifted to the height of 503 metres vertically.”

He added that this was one of the three projects under the JJM which has been completed, and that “the works on the other two projects to provide water supply to Zatting and Taying Zong are ongoing and will be completed in the days to come.”

Nipa said that, “as there is no land compensation under the JJM, getting land for projects is often challenging.” He commended the people of Niausa for donating land for the project, “which helped in completion of the project successfully.”

The EE informed that “one of the major components of the project is installation of solar water pumping system, which includes automation for auto pump on/off, depending on water level for dry run protection of intake pumps and overflow control.”

“The system will also provide a total water delivery report on a daily basis,” he added.


The programme was attended by HoDs, PRI leaders, officers and the people of Niausa village.

The court ordered that the writ petition be tagged with the original suit (No 2) of 1988 (State of Assam vs Union of India).

The people (of the affected villages) are strongly opposed to the looping of the land in respect of Durpai, Champak Chojo and Sogum villages of Arunachal and Pasoni Camp, Kailaspur, Rasbongsi, Modonpur and Jengrai villages of Assam.

The matter was heard by a three-judge bench led by the CJI. It has been listed next for 3 November.

The petition was filed by one Reli Kena and 12 others. Reportedly, the legal representatives of the Assam and the Arunachal governments did not turn up during the hearing. They have been directed to attend the next hearing.

The MoU was signed to settle the interstate boundary disputes between Assam and Arunachal in respect of 123 villages placed before the local commission by the state government [vide Letter No HMB (B)-69/2006 Vol-I, dated 26 December, 2007].

Earlier, the people of Durpai, under the aegis of the Durpai Development Committee, had written to Chief Minister Pema Khandu, opposing the looping system. They went to the SC in August and filed a writ petition, opposing the looping system.

“First of all, the MoU was signed without even consulting affected people like us. Secondly, there is no clarity in the MoU. We oppose it and therefore we had to knock on the door of the SC after the state government failed to address our grievances,” said Reli Kena.

He alleged that “the looping system is an attempt to take away the land of the people of Durpai and deprive them of their rightful ownership of the land.”

“Durpai is the oldest village in Kangku circle of Lower Siang district. We have been paying revenues to various government departments of the state since ages. How can suddenly we accept this decision to loop our village with those of Assam?” he said.

Meanwhile, the people of Durpai have appealed to the state government to support them in the court.

In July 2022, Arunachal and Assam signed the Namsai Declaration with the aim of resolving the boundary disputes between the two states. The declaration was signed after the chief ministers of both the states – Khandu and Himanta Biswa Sarma – held a crucial meeting with the cabinet ministers of the two states in Namsai to “restrict or minimise the boundary disputes between the two states in respect of 123 villages placed before the local commission by Arunachal in 2007,” the declaration read.

The two states share a nearly 800-kilometre-long boundary.","The Supreme Court heard a petition from Durpai villagers opposing the MoU signed by Assam and Arunachal Pradesh regarding land looping.

Gandhi’s remarks at a press conference during the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra here in Nagaland came days after the Congress top brass declined the invitation to the event at the Ram temple in Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh.

“The RSS and the BJP have made the 22 January function a completely political, Narendra Modi function.

It has become an RSS-BJP function. I think that is why the Congress president (Mallikarjun Kharge) said he will not go to the function. We are open to all religions, all practices. Even the biggest authorities of the Hindu religion have made their views public on what they think about the 22 January event – that it is a political function,” Gandhi said.

“It is difficult for us to go to a political function, which is designed around the prime minister of India and the RSS. We have made it clear that whoever among our partners or our party would like to visit the Ram temple is welcome to do it. It is difficult for us to visit (the temple) on 22 January. That this is a prime minister’s function and an RSS function and we are going to attend it… it is not possible,” he added.

“We cannot be a party to a political function. It is very difficult for us when the prime minister of India and the RSS, our principal opponents, have captured a function and turned it into an election function. The BJP and the RSS have given an election flavour to the event,” the former Congress chief said.

On the opposition INDIA bloc, he asserted that the alliance is strong and will defeat the BJP in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.

“There is mutual respect and affection between the leaders in the INDIA formation. The INDIA formation is an ideological formation that is placing itself in opposition to the idea of the RSS and the BJP. I am very confident that small problems in the alliance will be resolved. We will fight together and defeat them,” Gandhi said.

Replying to a question on the status of the alliance with the Trinamool Congress, he said, “The status of the INDIA alliance is very good. We are in conversation with our partners, the issue of seat sharing is being taken up, and I think it is going quite well. A lot of those are quite simple, I am quite confident that they will be resolved.”

Gandhi asserted that the opposition alliance would win the Lok Sabha polls expected to be held in April-May.

“The idea that people of all faiths should live harmoniously in India, and that all communities, languages and traditions should be respected is under attack,” Gandhi said at a public rally here after the yatra entered Meghalaya from Assam.

“To protect the idea of India, we walked from the sea in Kanyakumari to the mountains of Kashmir (in 2022-’23). We listened to the voices of farmers, labourers and young people,” he said.

“After that Bharat Jodo Yatra, many people wanted us to listen to the voices of the people living in Northeast, Odisha, Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. So we decided to go ahead with another yatra from Manipur to Maharashtra,” he said.

The former Congress president said that “many people

wondered why the yatra began in Manipur, and the reason is that the ideology of the RSS and the BJP has destroyed the idea of Manipur.”

“The politics of hatred and violence have torn the state apart, causing hundreds of deaths and thousands of people to lose their property. It’s a complete tragedy. That’s why we wanted to send a message to the rest of India about the pain the people of Manipur are feeling,” he said.

“It is astonishing to me that the prime minister of India has not visited Manipur yet. Is Manipur not an Indian state? Are the people of Manipur not part of India?” he said.

If the PM wanted to stop the violence in Manipur, he could have done it in three days, Gandhi claimed.

“If he had told the Indian Army that the violence in Manipur should be stopped, I am confident that the Indian Army would have stopped it within days. The truth is, he is not interested in putting an end to the violence in Manipur. The government of India is happy to let Manipur burn and its people suffer,” he said.

The prime minister has visited so many states but he refuses to go to Manipur, he added.

The yatra went from Manipur to Nagaland, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, and has now come to Meghalaya.

“We respect your culture, language and traditions and we believe fundamentally that Meghalaya should be ruled from Meghalaya,” the Congress leader told the gathering.

“The voices of Meghalaya, Manipur and Arunachal are now being attacked. Your tradition, history and way of life are being attacked by the RSS,” he said.

Shah himself had called the Meghalaya government the most corrupt in the country, and shortly after making this statement partnered with the ruling National People’s Party for the 2023 assembly elections, he said.

Gandhi said that the Khasi and Garo languages of Meghalaya are not included in the 8th Schedule while the power of the autonomous councils has been snatched away and decentralisation of power is being reversed slowly.

“These are some of the issues we want to raise in the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, but the most important thing is that it is aimed at talking and listening to you. I am not here to tell my ‘mann ki baat’ but listen to your ‘mann ki baat’,” he said, with a veiled reference to Modi’s monthly radio programme.

Gandhi further said that he is their “soldier in Delhi.”

“Whatever you need from me in Delhi, I will always try and deliver to you,” he said.

Unlike last year, the exam is being conducted in three shifts this time. Earlier, the exam was scheduled to be held from 21 to 31 May, but the

National Testing Agency (NTA) decided to extend the schedule by at least four days to accommodate the higher number of candidates.

University Grants Commission (UGC) Chairman M Jagadesh Kumar advised the students to answer questions only if they are confident about the correct answer.

“Read the questions carefully. Answer the questions only if you are confident about their correctness, as there will be negative marking. Remain calm and focus on your efforts without worrying about the outcome. Even if you cannot do the test well, remember there is always a tomorrow and another opportunity to do well,” he said.

Over 14 lakh applications have been received for the CUET-UG this year, registering a 41 percent increase from the debut edition last year.

The CUET-UG remains the second-largest entrance exam in the country in terms of applicants. In the debut edition of CUET-UG, 12.5 lakh students registered themselves and 9.9 lakhs of them submitted their applications.

“About 8 lakh students are appearing in the first phase 21 to 25 May. Almost equal number of boys and girls will be writing. Nearly 750 centres spread in all states and UTs are being used. Exams are being conducted in this phase in nearly 200 paper combinations,” Kumar said.

The UGC had in March last year announced that undergraduate admissions will be conducted in all central universities through a common entrance test and not based on Class 12 marks.

The debut edition of the CUET-UG was conducted in July last year and was marred by glitches, prompting the NTA to cancel the exam at multiple centres.

While several students were informed about the cancellation a night before the exam, many of them were turned away from centres.

The UGC chairman had then said that the exam at certain centres had been cancelled following reports of “sabotage.”

“NTA has taken all measures to test the readiness of all centres regarding computers, network infrastructure, and security. SoPs are given to observers and invigilators for all centres. Dummy tests have been conducted to check for any possible issues.

“Extra computers have been arranged at each centre. In case of any unforeseen problems with computers, students can be quickly shifted to these computers,” he said.

Addressing a press conference at the AICC headquarters here, Gandhi said the opposition has to present a national ideology before people, which regional outfits do not have and only the Congress has.
He also said there is a need for the opposition parties to have “mutual respect” for each other.
Gandhi noted that the Bharat Jodo Yatra is a framework and a way of thinking of the Congress on bringing people together.
This was Gandhi’s ninth press conference ever since he started the foot march on September 7.
The Congress leader also spoke about a clear foreign policy, unlike a “confused” policy pursued by the BJP-led government, and greater economic equality.
Gandhi alleged that China and Pakistan have come together and it is a dangerous development because the government “mishandled” the foreign policy. He called upon the government to admit its mistakes, take corrective measures and tell the country what happened at the border with China, adding that the opposition will extend its full support to it.
The Congress leader said he considers the RSS-BJP as his “guru” as they constantly show him the path that should not be taken. “The more they attack us, the more it gives us the opportunity to improve ourselves,” he said.
Gandhi claimed that all the opposition parties are with the Bharat Jodo Yatra but in today’s atmosphere, they have political and other compulsions that are keeping them away from joining it. He, however, said the doors of the yatra are open to anyone who wants a united India, free from violence and hatred.
“I think if the opposition stands effectively with a vision, what I am hearing and seeing from the ground, it will be very difficult for the BJP to win. But the opposition has to coordinate properly and it has to go to the people of India with an alternative vision. There is a huge undercurrent against the BJP, a massive undercurrent,” he said.
Gandhi asserted that this is no longer a tactical fight, where one party joins hands with another and defeats the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
“This is so as the entire institutional framework of the country is in the hands of one ideology and it dominates the country’s political space completely. To defeat them now, there is a need for an alternative ideology,” he said.
Noting that he respects the other opposition parties and their leaders, Gandhi said if one looks at the Samajwadi Party (SP), it does not have a national ideology.
“They do have a positioning in Uttar Pradesh…. But they do not have a national ideology. The SP’s idea will not work in Kerala, Karnataka or Bihar. So there is a need for a central ideological framework, which only the Congress can provide and that is our role.
“But our role is also to make the opposition people feel comfortable and that they are respected,” he said, adding that there should be mutual respect for each other.
“The idea of Bharat Jodo is a framework. It is a way of working, a way of thinking. Of course, I am not the Congress president and a lot of work in that direction will probably be done by the Congress president. But it is about bringing people together and making them feel comfortable,” Gandhi said on opposition unity.
Spelling out his vision for the country, he said India should emerge as a “production nation”, instead of a “rent-seeking” nation. It should have an education policy that allows children to give wings to their imagination and look beyond careers in medicine, engineering, civil services and law, the Congress leader added.
“My focus is on the idea that India should be united and that we fight hatred and anger with love, affection and harmony. We are providing an alternative vision for the country and that is what I have to focus on,” he said.
Gandhi said he is in favour of large businesses as they play a central role in the economy, but the same should not be controlled by “two-three people”.
“I absolutely agree that there is a place for large businesses and they have a central role to play in India’s future. But it cannot be that two or three business people run this country. It cannot be,” he stressed.
The Congress MP said there are talks of another East-West Yatra, but the Bharat Jodo Yatra is trying to say something and if that message is ignored, “then in a way, it will be an insult to the voice of India”.
He said there are similarities in the ideologies of the opposition parties and there are many like SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Mayawati who want an India of love and do not want an India of hatred.
Gandhi accused the Centre of using different security protocols for BJP leaders and for him, noting that the current regime wants him to undertake the “Bharat Jodo Yatra” in a bulletproof vehicle, which is not acceptable to him. He alleged that the government is trying to make a case against him that he does not follow security protocols. (PTI)
“I am undertaking the Bharat Jodo Yatra and the government wants me to do it in a bulletproof vehicle. They say it is protocol and I should not trouble them. They want me to travel from Kanyakumari to Kashmir in a bulletproof car, which is not acceptable to me. How can I sit in a bulletproof vehicle in this yatra?” he asked and alleged that when BJP leaders violate security protocols, it is not talked about.

Though wildlife officials used to witness the arrival of the avian visitors to the area during December, January or early February each year, the winged guests have arrived early this year. Several flocks of birds, most of which have migrated from Siberia and Mongolia, were seen in various water bodies of the sanctuary from the second week of November.


Apart from migratory birds, a large number of grassland-dependent bird species, such as the swamp francolin (Francolinus gularis), the Jerdon’s babbler (Chryssoma altirostre), the swamp prinia, and the black-breasted parrotbill (Paradoxornis flavirostris) are also found in the sanctuary’s grassland.

As per record, over 150 bird species have been reported, including endangered birds like the Bengal florican (Houbaropsis bengalensis). The most recent estimate is of 60-70 pairs, as per the BNHS.

The DEWS is located near Pasighat, the headquarters of East Siang district, and covers an area of approximately 190 square kms. It is sandwiched between the Siang and the Sibya rivers in East Siang district. The sanctuary lies in the low-altitude floodplains on the boundary of Arunachal Pradesh and Assam.

The sanctuary has extensive floodplain grasslands (about 80 percent). Saccharum spontaneum, S arundinaceum and Neyraudia reynaudina are the main grass species, and sedges such as cyperus sp also occur. Other habitat types include riverine forests with tree species such as Terminalia myriocarpa, Bombax ceiba and Dillenia indica.

The sanctuary is known for its rich biodiversity and has been regaining its past glory in the last four years, thanks to the intensified round-the-clock patrolling and intensive action against hunters and poachers, including timber mafias, by the present sanctuary authority.


The sanctuary authority has a limited number of staffers, most of whom are in casual/contingency positions and have been serving at the sanctuary for the last 30 years, besides other recently recruited ones.

In our committed effort to secure the sanctuary from hunting and other illegal activities to revive the sanctuary in the real sense, we have seized more than 20 guns, and around 30 hunters/poachers have been arrested in the last four years.

In the process of protecting the sanctuary in the true sense, some serious actions were needed, despite public opposition and reaction (mostly from those who sympathise with hunters and support hunting), but we did it even by banning fishing activities of the public and fishermen engaged by local fish mahaldars deep inside the sanctuary, as many people were found laying cable traps and even hunting on the pretext of fishing in the sanctuary’s rivers in the past.

Apart from intensified patrolling, our field staff and officials, and the Eco-Development Committee members, are constantly mobilising the people of the fringe areas to protect the flora and fauna of this riverine island sanctuary, which is necessary for maintaining the ecology of the region for larger human interest. (Tasang Taga is DFO, DEWS, Pasighat.)","Migratory birds have begun arriving early this year at the Daying Ering Wildlife Sanctuary (DEWS) in East Siang district, Arunachal Pradesh, attracting nature enthusiasts and wildlife officials.

33,The Arunachal Times,13/09/2022,https://arunachaltimes.in/index.php/2022/09/13/china-is-not-trustworthy-in-recognising-lac/,China is not trustworthy in recognising LAC,"The decision on phased withdrawal of Indian and Chinese troops from one of the friction areas in the Ladakh region is a positive development, but there is no reason to drop the guard as Beijing refuses to recognise the status quo as it existed in April 2020, when the current military standoff began. China also continues to behave belligerently. The recent act of carrying out construction activities inside Indian territory at Chaglagam in Anjaw district shows that China is still aggressively behaving along the line of actual control (LAC).

The agreement on disengagement of frontline troops in the Hot Springs area along the LAC came after months of protracted negotiations between the military commanders of the two countries. The Chinese created many obstacles in the talks.

While the move is the right step towards restoration of peace, there is a need to resolve all pending border disputes once and for all, as suggested by the Indian side. China continues to complicate the matters by claiming that the status quo was created by “illegal trespassing on the Indian side” – a contention that goes against the ground realities. Restoration of the status quo and the violation of agreements and protocols for border management through China’s action of amassing troops along the LAC are among the key issues raised by New Delhi. Hot Springs is only the third friction point where the two countries have agreed on the disengagement of troops during the 16th round of corps commander level meeting, but the bigger problems at the friction points of Depsang and Demchok remain to be addressed, largely due to the intransigence of the Chinese side.

China has persistently refused to accept these two locations as friction points, contending that they are not part of the current face-off. The site of the latest disengagement is near the area where at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers were killed in the June 2020 clash. With the PLA trying to shift the LAC westwards, the unresolved areas could turn into new flashpoints. A new crisis in eastern Ladakh or elsewhere along the LAC would undo the gains made in the form of disengagement over the last two years.","The phased withdrawal of Indian and Chinese troops from the Hot Springs area in Ladakh is a positive step towards de-escalation, but India remains cautious as China refuses to recognize the pre-April 2020 status quo. Despite negotiations, China continues aggressive actions, including construction inside Indian territory in Anjaw district, indicating ongoing tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).

While the disengagement in Hot Springs marks progress, larger unresolved issues at key friction points like Depsang and Demchok remain due to China's refusal to acknowledge them as part of the current standoff. India's focus is on restoring the status quo and addressing China's military build-up along the LAC, which could trigger new flashpoints if left unresolved. The disengagement efforts must be consolidated, but ongoing tensions require vigilance to prevent future crises.",International News

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing here that China attaches high importance to Indian students’ concerns about returning to China for studies.

“We have shared with the Indian sides the procedures and experience of other countries’ students returning to China. Actually, the work for Indian students’ return has already been started.

All that remains to be done is for the Indian side to provide the list of students who really need to come back to China,” he said.

As per earlier reports, over 23,000 Indian students, mostly studying medicine in Chinese colleges, are stuck in India after they returned home as the coronavirus broke out in China in December 2019. They could not return to China due to the restrictions imposed by the Chinese government to arrest the spread of the contagion.

Since then, they made desperate attempts to return to China to rejoin their classes but had to confine to online classes as Beijing cancelled all flights and visas for Indians.

Besides the students, hundreds of families of Indians working in China too were stuck back home in view of China cancelling visas and flights from India.

“We understand that there is a large number of Indian students studying in China. India may need some time to collect the names. China is ready to receive some of Indian students under the current complicated severe epidemic situation. In handling foreign students returning to China for studies, we need to take into consideration the international epidemic situation, the evolving circumstances, and their majors. This principle applies equally to all foreign students,” Lijian said.

Asked about the timeline to permit the return of Indian students, Lijian said that the Chinese embassy in India and existing channels will work to facilitate and offer convenience to the students.

To a question whether China has provided any criteria to India to select students to return, Lijian said: “I don’t have the information about the specifics you asked, but I am sure these details will be sorted out through communication through existing channels, including the embassy, so that we will actually deliver the good news.”

Following the Chinese announcement, the Indian embassy here sought the details of the students intending to return.

Following the meeting of India’s External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar with China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi on 25 March, 2022, the Chinese side has expressed its willingness to consider facilitating the return of Indian students to China on a need-assessed basis, the Indian embassy here said in a statement.

“In order to facilitate this (return), the Indian embassy intends to prepare a list of such students which will be shared with the Chinese side for their consideration. Therefore, Indian students are requested to provide necessary information by filling up the Google form at this link (https://forms.gle/MJmgByc7BrJj9MPv7), latest by 8 May, 2022,” it said.

Once the collated information is shared with the Chinese side, they would consult relevant Chinese departments to verify the list and indicate whether the identified students can travel to China to complete the course, the statement said.

This coordination process would be carried out in a time-bound manner, it said.

The Chinese side has also conveyed that eligible students should unconditionally abide by the Covid-19 prevention measures, and agree to bear all expenses related to Covid-19 prevention measures by themselves, it said.

In recent months, China has been permitting students from some friendly countries like Pakistan, Thailand, the Solomon Islands and recently Sri Lanka to return but remained silent about allowing Indian students as well as hundreds of family members of Indians working in China to travel back. (PTI)","China has announced plans to allow the return of some Indian students who have been stranded in India for over two years due to Covid-19 restrictions.

About 20 farmers of Ngorlung village have started mahogany (Swietenia mahagoni) plantation in 30 hectares of land at Ngorlung Moruk, near the Industrial Growth Centre in Ngorluk.

One of the farmers, Ajom Tarang (50), of Ngorlung village, said that an Itanagar-based NGO inspired him to adopt mahogany cultivation on a commercial basis. The NGO also conducted a training programme on mahogany tree farming at Ruksin and supervised the plantation activities at the initial stage.

Tarang said that he has successfully grown 5,000 trees in his farmland and the saplings are now four years old.

 The farmers urged the state government to prepare a scheme to help the mahogany planters, considering the importance of the tree species.

Mahogany is considered one of the most priced timber trees in India. It grows to 60 metres in height and can have a trunk diameter measuring up to 4 to 5 metres. One thousand plants can fetch an income of about Rs 1 crore in 10 years.

The seeds are also sold at a high price as these are used to produce medicines and cosmetics.

Swietenia mahagoni, commonly known as American mahogany or small-leaved mahogany, belongs to the meliaceae family and is native to the tropical areas of south Florida in the United States and the islands of the Caribbean, including the Bahamas, Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispaniola. It is commercially imported for its best quality timber with high durability and water resistance property.","Farmers in East Siang district are turning to mahogany tree farming, following rubber and oil palm cultivation.

“There is no accurate data on the number of refugees, but India has about 4,00,000 refugees, including 2,38,222 recognized and documented refugees, ie, Sri Lankan refugees, Tibetan refugees and refugees recognized by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), about 31,313 refugees belonging to minority communities from neighbouring countries who have been given LTVs on the basis of their claims of religious persecution and want Indian citizenship, and about 1,23,000 unregistered Chin and Rohingya refugees,” said RRAG director Suhas Chakma in a release.

In 2021, at least 414 refugees, mainly from Myanmar, ie, about 354 Rohingyas and 60 Chins and other ethnic Myanmarese nationals, were arrested by police in various states of India. The highest number of arrests was reported from Jammu & Kashmir with 174, followed by Delhi (95), Assam (55), Manipur (30), Uttar Pradesh and Haryana (19 each), West Bengal (13), Telangana (6) and Tripura (3). “Non-Myanmarese refugees like the Tibetans and Sri Lankan Tamils do not face such arrest and detention for illegal entry into India,” Chakma said.

“Given that no refugee law exists in India, the treatment of refugees is guided by geo-political interest and vote bank politics,” he said.

“While India extends full support to the Tibetan refugees and the Sri Lankan Tamil refugees, including welfare measures worth Rs 317.40 crores announced by the Tamil Nadu government in August 2021, India targets refugees from other countries, in particular the Rohingyas. While Chin refugees from Myanmar received modicum of protection including non-refoulement, at least 1,177 Rohingya immigrants were arrested/detained or rescued from trafficking by police in different states during 2017-2021. These arrests included 386 in West Bengal, 187 in Jammu & Kashmir, 141 in Telangana, 123 in Tripura, 98 Rohingyas in Delhi, 98 in Assam, 53 in Manipur, 35 in Mizoram, 19 each in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, seven in Karnataka, eight in Kerala, and three in Rajasthan,” he said.

“The response of the Supreme Court of India on the Rohingya refugees remained wanting. On 8 April, 2021, the Supreme Court in a departure declined to issue direction to the union of India and Jammu & Kashmir administration to release the 168 Rohingya refugees detained at a sub-jail in Jammu. It merely directed not to deport any of them to Myanmar without the procedure prescribed for such deportation, despite the risks of torture and non-acceptance by Myanmar itself. The question remains as Myanmar does not accept the Rohingyas, will India detain the refugees forever waiting deportation with the sanction of the Supreme Court?” Chakma said.

He said that the Covid-19 pandemic had a ravaging impact on different refugee communities in India. “The UNHCR’s ‘cash-based assistance’ has been found to be highly inadequate both in scale and coverage. Nearly 56 percent Rohingya refugees living across India lost employment due to the pandemic. As many as six Chin refugees succumbed to Covid-19 infection during the second wave of the pandemic, often without any medical care in government hospitals because they lacked the documentation or money required for private hospitalization. For vaccination against Covid-19, registration with CoWin platform requires use of the government-approved identity card such as an Aadhaar card, passport, permanent account number, etc. The refugees, especially the unrecognized and undocumented ones, are not eligible for these documents and further, private healthcare services are inaccessible due to high costs.

“The taking over of Afghanistan by the Taliban on 15 August, 2021 exposed inadequacy of India’s controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) to protect any asylum seeker belonging to minority communities from the war ravaged nation. The Afghan Sikh and Hindu minorities, including lawmakers Anarkali Kaur Honaryar and Narender Singh Khalsa, are not eligible for protection under the CAA applicable as they have not entered India on or before 31.12.2014, the date set by the CAA.

“Further, dozens of lawmakers from Afghanistan and Myanmar have taken shelter in India during 2021 and they remain excluded from any protection measure.

“The refugees shall continue to flee to India. Unless India adopts a refugee law, the asylum seekers shall not register with the government of India for mere deportation. This will not address the security concerns and will close the possibility for any repatriation. The absence of any refugee law is counter-productive. India needs to enact a refugee law,” said Chakma.","According to the Rights and Risks Analysis Group (RRAG) report, ""India: The Status of Refugees – 2021,"" around 20,000 refugees, primarily from Myanmar, and 4,557 Afghan refugees were in India by December 2021. The total number of refugees in India is estimated at 400,000, including recognized and unregistered individuals. The report highlights that while Tibetan and Sri Lankan Tamil refugees receive support, Rohingyas face arrests and detention. The Supreme Court has been criticized for its handling of Rohingya cases. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated refugee hardships, revealing gaps in assistance and access to healthcare.

The 435.5-km Lhasa-Nyingchi section of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway is expected to be inaugurated ahead of the centenary celebrations of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) on 1 July, according to official media reports.

The electricity transmission process has been completed and tested, Liu Yuxiang, Chief Engineer of the Lhasa-Nyingchi Railway, was quoted as saying by the state-run CCTV earlier.

The Sichuan-Tibet Railway will be the second railway into Tibet after the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. It will go through the southeast of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, one of the world’s most geologically active areas.

In November, Chinese President Xi Jinping had instructed officials to expedite construction of the new railway project, connecting Sichuan province and Nyingchi in Tibet, saying the new rail line would play a key role in safeguarding the border stability.

The Sichuan-Tibet Railway starts from Chengdu, capital of Sichuan province, and travels through Ya’an and enters Tibet via Qamdo, shortening the journey from Chengdu to Lhasa from 48 hours to 13 hours.

Nyingchi is a prefecture-level city of Medog, which is adjacent to the Arunachal border.

China claims Arunachal as part of South Tibet, which is firmly rejected by India. The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long line of actual control (LAC).

Mr. Xi “pointed out that former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made efforts to improve China-Japan relations when he was in office and contributed positively to this endeavour”, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, adding that he “noted that he had reached important common understanding with Abe on building a China-Japan relationship that meets the need of the new era”.

“Xi also noted that he deeply regrets Abe’s sudden passing and stands ready to work with Prime Minister Kishida to continue to develop a China-Japan relationship of good-neighbourliness, friendshipand cooperation in accordance with the principles of the four China-Japan political documents,” the MFA said, adding that Mr. Xi and First Lady Peng Liyuan sent a message of condolences to Akie Abe, wife of the former Prime Minister.

Mr. Xi’s message on Saturday followed a day of wide attention on Chinese social media on Mr. Abe’s death. Thousands of messages posted by Chinese social media users celebrated the assassination, while one essay that expressed alarm and revulsion at those messages, and pointed to the impact of decades of anti-Japanese state propaganda, went viral before being censored on WeChat.

“The radical nationalism on show has damaged China’s image internationally and may complicate Beijing’s efforts to improve relations with other countries,” the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post quoted commentators as saying, noting that many on Chinese social media saw Mr. Abe “as representative of a Japanese right-wing in denial about the country’s war crimes” and hit out at his visits to the Yasukuni shrine that includes honours for war criminals.

Chinese commentators were divided on the reaction with some defending the messages. Nationalist commentator Sima Nan who has a wide following online said, “If we express happiness, foreigners might say we are ruthless and lack humanitarian spirit… but we should do whatever we want.”

Others criticised the responses and said they had damaged China’s image abroad. “Hatred of the West and polarisation among Chinese over certain issues have existed in China for a long time, but the hostile comments over Abe’s death have greatly damaged China’s image,” one political scientist who did not want to be named told The Post. “It is very nasty.

Sale deeds were also executed at the Rangareddy district registrar’s office. However, later a public sector bank wrote on its walls that the property was under equitable mortgage. The aggrieved person was later promised original documents by the fraudsters and was also issued a cheque for the pending loan amount; however, it was dishonoured for want of funds","On Friday, the XV Additional Metropolitan Magistrate in Ibrahimpatnam convicted B. Raghu Veera Reddy, P. Shivaji, and Kalpana Pal for cheating and criminal breach of trust related to a 2009 property sale case. The trio was sentenced to three years in prison and fined ₹20,000 each. They were found guilty of misrepresenting property details and executing fraudulent sale deeds. The property was later found to be under mortgage, and attempts to rectify the situation, including issuing a dishonored cheque, failed.",Crime and Justice

On his way home from work, he had stopped at Andhra Bhavan and packed some mutton fry. The dish was hot and spicy, and he liked it so much that he went all misty-eyed while describing it.

It got me all nostalgic too, for I had been thinking of visiting this old haunt of mine for a while now. There was a time when we went there every other Sunday for a plate of Hyderabadi biryani. The thali was a special favourite, for one could eat as much as one wished to (for ₹14 when I first started going there).

I often went for breakfast too — and enjoyed my cup of hot filter coffee, the soft idlis and crisp vadas.

The prices have gone up since then. I was there one weekday recently and heard that the breakfast — coffee, with one piece each of idli, vada, one dosa — cost ₹130. The non-sharing vegetarian lunch thali is for ₹200 – and consists of rice, puris, a special rice dish, dal, two kinds of vegetable dishes, chutney, sambar, rasam, curd, papad, pickle and a sweet. Rotis replace puris in the dinner thali.

The Andhra Bhavan canteen (also called Andhra and Telangana canteen), I found, was as busy as ever. The place is meant for people who like their food spicy. I did so at one time but over the years, I have lost my passion for hot food — though I must admit I still enjoy it.

I decided to place an order for home delivery — and asked for their ‘Carrier meal’, which at ₹490, has all the ingredients that adorn the regular thali. And, of course, we wanted their mutton — so I ordered two plates of boneless mutton fry (₹300).

I was not disappointed. Many Andhra Bhavan afficionados believe that over the years the standard of the food has fallen. However, the dishes I had were as they used to be — hot and spicy, even though I had asked for a non-spicy platter.

The rasam was excellent, and helped a young dinner guest clear his sinuses. I liked the sambar, the carrot vegetable dish, the dal with bits of spinach and the eggplant curry. I liked the sweet dish too — a soft halwa — and enjoyed the juicy mutton immensely.

I didn’t order the biryani this time. When we started having their biryani with the glistening egg, it cost ₹60. The chicken dum biryani is now for ₹300 while the mutton biryani, available only on weekends, is for ₹350.

Sometime back, when Andhra Bhavan ruled, Delhi didn’t have too many places offering Hyderabadi biryani. But in the last 15 years, restaurants and outlets — such as Bagundi, Andhra Canteen, Sassy Begum, Bikkgane and Andhra Kodi Pulao — have mushroomed across town offering Andhra and Hyderabad cuisines, prepared by talented khansamas who focus more on the flavours than on the chillies.

Despite the ups and downs, I enjoyed the Andhra Bhavan fare. It was sheer nostalgia, garnished with red chillies.","A recent dinner experience had me reminiscing about Andhra Bhavan, a favorite spot from my past. A friend’s description of their spicy mutton fry reignited my nostalgia. I recalled our frequent visits for Hyderabadi biryani and the thali, which once cost ₹14 for unlimited servings.

Although prices have increased—breakfast now costs ₹130 and a non-sharing vegetarian thali is ₹200—the quality of food remains commendable. My recent home delivery included the ‘Carrier meal’ for ₹490 and two plates of boneless mutton fry for ₹300. Despite some claims that the food’s quality has declined, the meal was as hot and flavorful as I remembered. The rasam was excellent, and the mutton was juicy and satisfying.

The Andhra Bhavan has been a pillar of spicy Andhra and Hyderabadi cuisine in Delhi, even as new competitors have emerged. Despite the changes over time, the nostalgic flavors and spicy dishes continue to be a delight.",Lifestyle and Features

Rodrygo scored both goals and Madrid maintained its comfortable lead at the top after Barcelona had won 1-0 at Las Palmas on Saturday.

Vinícius didn't play because of a suspension over yellow cards, but Jude Bellingham was back in the squad after missing two straight league games because of a red-card suspension. The influential England international set up Rodrygo's second goal in Madrid's third straight league win.

Rodrygo's opener came with a beautiful shot into the top corner from just outside the area eight minutes into the match at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium.

The Brazil forward had scored for Brazil in a friendly against Spain at the Bernabeu last week, but he hadn't found the net for Madrid in seven consecutive games.

“He played very well, made the difference with some high-quality plays,” Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said about Rodrygo.

The Brazilian said after the match he is not feeling threatened by the possible arrival of Kylian Mbappé.

“I think he is close (to being signed), from what everybody has been saying,” Rodrygo said. “I'm just focused on finishing the season well. It would be a nice problem for the coach to have next season. I'm not worried.”

Fourth-place Athletic arrived with its focus on next weekend's Copa del Rey final against Mallorca. The Basque Country club will try to win the cup for the first time in four decades. Defender Yeray Álvarez left Sunday's game with an apparent muscle injury in the 25th and could be doubtful for the final in Seville.

Athletic, which had won two in a row in the league, will drop to fifth place if Atletico Madrid wins at midtable Villarreal on Monday.

Also back in Madrid's squad was central defender Éder Militão, who had been out for eight months because of a knee injury. He came off the bench in stoppage time to loud cheers from the Bernabeu crowd.

Brahim Díaz, who was in for Vinícius, nearly added to Madrid's lead in the 49th with a shot that hit the post.

Tuesday's “One Skin” friendly between Brazil and Spain at the Bernabeu, which ended 3-3, was set up after Vinícius was targeted by racial insults in a league match nearly a year ago.

Sunday's league games came a day after the match between Getafe and Sevilla was marred by more racist insults against Sevilla player Marcos Acuña and Sevilla coach Quique Sánchez Flores.

Madrid wore its purple fourth uniform instead of its traditional white jersey.

STUANI LEADS GIRONA
Cristhian Stuani scored in stoppage time as Girona beat Real Betis 3-2 to move closer to securing a top-four finish.

The home win strengthened Girona's hold on third place. It's nine points ahead of fourth-place Athletic and 10 points in front of fifth-place Atletico Madrid, the first team outside the Champions League qualification places.

Girona visits Atletico next weekend in a key matchup with eight rounds remaining.

The Catalan club, which is part of the Abu Dhabi-backed City Football Group, is trying to make it to the Champions League for the first time.

Girona twice relinquished leads against seventh-place Betis, but earned the victory thanks to Stuani's goal from inside the area two minutes into second-half stoppage time in pouring rain at Montilivi Stadium.

Artem Dovbyk scored the other two goals for the hosts, while Willian José got on the board twice for Betis, which saw its losing streak reach four straight league matches. Manuel Pellegrini's team has one win in its last eight games in all competitions.

RELEGATION FIGHT
Celta Vigo and Rayo Vallecano drew 0-0 in Vigo in a match between relegation-threatened clubs.

The result left Celta in 17th place, immediately behind Rayo.

Celta sits three points clear of the relegation zone, while Rayo is five points from danger. Rayo has one win in 12 matches.

Celta complained about two calls that went against the team — the first on a goal called off because of a foul, and then for a possible penalty kick late in the game.

SOCIEDAD WINS AGAIN
Sixth-place Real Sociedad picked up its third straight victory by winning 1-0 at 13th-place Alaves.

Jon Pacheco scored the winner with a diving header in the 59th.

The govt. has proved its commitment to fulfilling all assurances made in the Assembly, says CM.","On the occasion of the launch of free distribution of laptops for Class 11 and 12 students in government schools in Puducherry, Chief Minister N. Rangasamy on Wednesday said it was the NDA government that has proved its commitment to fulfilling all assurances made in the Assembly.

“The distribution of free laptops as announced in the budget was the only scheme yet to be implemented. Today, we have launched this scheme also. Our government is committed to fulfilling all promises made to the people in the Assembly. Some schemes announced outside the Assembly were also implemented,” the Chief Minister said.

Mr. Rangasamy, along with Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan launched the scheme at the Government Girls Higher Secondary School. The Chief Minister said the government would incur an expenditure to the tune of ₹68 crore to implement the scheme. 

Listing out the programmes initiated by his government in the last two and a half years, Mr. Rangasamy said around 1.60 lakh families started getting subsidies for LPG cylinders after the government took a decision to provide ₹300 per cylinder for BPL families and ₹150 per cylinder for APL ration card holders.

The launch of the scheme to provide monthly assistance of ₹ 1,000 to women in the age group of 21 to 55 years in the BPL category has so far benefitted around 50,000 people. Around 20,000 more women would be added to the beneficiary list soon, he said.

The Chief Minister also highlighted the scheme to deposit ₹50,000 in the name of new born girl children in nationalised banks and the policy decision to provide 10% reservation to NEET-qualified government school students inmedical colleges.

“The government is able to implement all the schemes with the active support of the Union government,” he added.

Appeal to students
The Chief Minister appealed to the students to be on guard against the prevailing drug menace among the student community. “You should be cautious as getting into drug addiction can spoil the life of the individual and the family.”

Speaking on the occasion, Dr. Soundararajan said computers have become part of the educational system. She urged the students to work hard to become successful in life. The Lt. Governor also advised the students to use the laptops in proper manner. 

Home Minister A. Namassivayam, who also holds the education portfolio, said as many as 7,419 and 8,140 students currently studying in Classes 11 and 12, respectively, would be given laptops before February 15. 

From next year, he said students joining Class 11 would be given laptops in the beginning of the academic year itself. He said the government intended to fill around 144 primary school teachers posts, 300 Trained Graduate Teachers (TGT), 67 lecturers and 45 TGT (language) posts in the next two months. The government has introduced CBSE syllabus in around 128 schools, he said.

Speaker R. Selvam and Minister for Agriculture C. Djeacoumar were present.","On Wednesday, Puducherry Chief Minister N. Rangasamy, alongside Lt.

47,The Hindu,30/09/2023,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cartoonist-sukumar-passes-away/article67366989.ece,Cartoonist Sukumar passes away,"Cartoonist Sukumar, who used his humour equally well on the paper and on the stage, passed away in Kochi on Saturday. He was 91.

One of the earliest figures in a long lineage of Malayalis making their mark in the world of cartoons, he has been known for his political cartoons filled with sharp critiques of the major leaders during his heydays. As someone who also spread laughter from stages across the State, one of the most memorable events in his life was the 12-hour laughter yajna that he led in 2012, which entered the Guinness Book of Records.

Born in 1932 at Attingal in the capital, Sukumar did not have any formal training in cartooning. His interest in cartoons was kindled by constantly following the political cartoons of K.S. Pillai, who used to draw cartoons both in Desabandhu and Malayala Manorama. His first cartoon appeared in a magazine when he was just 18 years old. After higher studies at University College here, he joined the Police department in 1957. He served in the department for three decades and retired as an administrative assistant.

For close to seven decades, he continued to use his wit and drawing skills to create cartoons for numerous publications. In one of his interviews, he had recounted that former Chief Ministers E.K.Nayanar and K.Karunakaran were the leaders whom he loved to draw the most. He has written close to 60 books, a majority of which were related to cartoons. He has also penned plays, poems and stories. One of his everlasting contributions will be the role he played in the founding of the Kerala Cartoon Academy as well as Narma Kairali, which became a platform for upcoming humourists. He won the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award in 1996.

He was interested in the history of cartooning in Kerala and spent two years digging out old cartoons for his book on the subject. At a function in the capital a few years back, he said that he found the first cartoon ever published in the State from a worn-out copy of the first issue of the magazine Vidooshakan published in October 1919. It was titled Maha kshama devatha and touched upon the drought situation, he had said. After spending much of his life in the capital, he shifted to Kochi in 2019, but remained active in the public sphere almost till the end.

Condoling his passing, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that Sukumar will be remembered for his witty criticism without a touch of malice.","Cartoonist Sukumar, aged 91, passed away in Kochi.

The incident took place on November 9 in Cincinnati, and he died two days later.

Adlakha was a fourth-year doctoral student in a molecular and developmental biology programme at the University of Cincinnati Medical School, said a university statement, which called his death ““sudden, tragic and senseless”.

On November 9. Lt. Jonathan Cunningham of the Cincinnati Police said that the police found Adlakha in critical condition inside a bullet-riddled vehicle that had crashed into a wall on the upper deck of the Western Hills Viaduct in Cincinnati. Passers-by had alerted the police after seeing a body inside the crashed car. Adlakha was shifted to the UC Medical Centre, but was declared dead two days later. No arrests have been made in the case, according to local media reports.

Condolences poured in from Adlakha’s college professors in Delhi following the news, with Ramjas College, where Adlakha had completed his bachelor’s degree in Zoology in 2018, holding a prayer meet in his memory.

Ramjas College held a prayer meet for Adlakha. “He was wonderful student, always ready with good grades and a bright smile,” said Dr. Mayanglambam Ojit Kumar Singh, associate professor at the college’s Zoology Department, adding that Adlakha’s loss felt “personal”.

“One thing I’ll remember are his assignments. Professors keep only a few students’ practical files and assignments for years. because they are extraordinary and will remain an example for years to come. Aaditya was one of those students,” Mr. Singh said, adding that he would remain a “brilliant example of the department forever”.

“There are a lot of things that one could remember about somebody who is that extraordinary,” said Smita Bhatia, who headed the Zoology Department during Adlakha’s time in college. Ms. Bhatia, who taught him physiology - a subject he later completed his master’s in from AIIMS in 2020 - said that Adlakha told her he was inspired by the subject and always thanked her for helping him study.

“Aaditya would sit in the front row only to ask the professor a question” Ms Bhatia added.

Adlakha was also mourned by the University of Cincinnati Medical School. “Those who knew him [Adlakha], along with fellow students and others who may not have had the fortune to have met Aaditya, may experience a wide variety of reactions, which are understandable and expected,” Senior Vice President of Health Affairs and Dean, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Andrew Filak said.

“He was much-loved, exceedingly kind and humorous, intelligent and sharp, whose research was described as novel and transformative. The focus of his work was to better understand neuroimmune communication and how neuroimmune interactions might contribute to pain and the inflammatory landscape in ulcerative colitis.” added Mr Filak.","Aaditya Adlakha, a 26-year-old Indian doctoral student at the University of Cincinnati Medical School, was shot inside his car in Cincinnati on November 9.

The order allowing Sanjay Kumar Mishra, head of the Enforcement Directorate (ED), to continue till September 15 at the Centre’s request is needlessly accommodative. It was only on July 11 that the Court declared illegal the extensions given to Mr. Mishra in 2021 and 2022. At the same time, he was permitted to continue till July 31 to ensure a smooth transition. Yet, without any submission that the process to select his successor has been set in motion, the Court has invoked an undefined “larger national interest” to allow him to go on up to September 15. It was a self-serving application in the first place. The ostensible reason that the government finds his services indispensable is that he is helming the country’s efforts to demonstrate its framework to counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism during a country review before the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The multi-lateral body adopts a mutual evaluation system and India’s ongoing review will go on until June 2024, when the final evaluation report may be considered at a likely plenary discussion on its compliance status. The government sought an extension of his services until October 15, presumably because the country’s agencies and institutions may be ready by then for an on-site visit by an FATF delegation.

As the agency that administers the law against money laundering, the ED may have a key role in preparing the country’s presentation, but it is difficult to believe that the process depends on one individual. Even if it were so, nothing prevented the government from utilising Mr. Mishra’s services for FATF purposes alone, while leaving the directorate’s routine activities under his successor. In any case, various agencies and authorities are involved in framing the country’s policies on money laundering and terrorism financing. It is unfortunate that the Court did not countenance arguments that highlighted these points. It did raise questions as to how one person could be indispensable, but ultimately chose to allow him to continue for some more time. One can understand the argument that the country’s image depends on a positive FATF evaluation, but the claim that not giving Mr. Mishra an extension might result in a “negative image” is quite incomprehensible. India’s credentials will be evaluated on its laws, systems and compliance with global standards and not on who prepared the report. The Court’s permissiveness detracts from its resolve to hold the government to account for actions that it had itself declared illegal.","The Supreme Court's decision to extend Sanjay Kumar Mishra's tenure as head of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) until September 15, despite previous rulings declaring his extensions illegal, raises concerns about excessive deference to government requests. The extension, granted to facilitate India's review by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), seems to prioritize procedural convenience over legal principles. The Court's decision to allow Mishra to continue without clear evidence of an ongoing successor selection process, and despite arguments that his continued presence is not critical, undermines its previous stance on accountability and legality. This leniency might detract from the Court’s commitment to uphold the law and hold the government accountable for actions deemed illegal.",Opinion and Editorial

However, it can be a tedious practice as the volume of transactions is high, diverse and requires parsing of many files. Through this article, we will be introduced to three utilities which can be used to make this job easier for us.

The three powerful text processing command-line utilities, grep, sed, and awk, available in the GNU Bash Shell and commonly available in GNU/Linux operating systems can help us keep track of personal spending and earnings. Windows 10 users can use the Ubuntu on Windows feature to utilise the bash shell. See https://bit.ly/UbuntuOnWin for instructions on how to download this in the Windows 10 environment.

Let us go through the process step-by-step.

All examples in this article make use of the sample data set Expenses.csv containing personal income and expenditure information. (The dataset is available here https://bit.ly/incomedataset). This dataset has the following structure.


Let us start with our first utility, grep, a powerful search utility that can be applied to text documents. The general form of using grep is

$ grep search_pattern file_list

Imagine we want to list all transactions on an American Express credit card. You can achieve that by giving the following command.

$ grep “American Express Credit Card” Expenses.csv


One has to note that the search parameter should be included within double quotes if it consists of any white space. Otherwise, quotes are not necessary.

Sometimes one would be more interested in getting the number of transactions of a particular type; let's say you want to count the number of pharmacy related transactions. The following command can achieve this.

$ grep -c Pharmacy Expenses.csv 


Another common thing we encounter is that we do not remember filenames that contain a specific text in a particular directory. Here also grep can come to the rescue; all you have to do is issue a command with the following syntax.

$ grep -lr search_pattern folder

Suppose we want to list all files recursively within the Article2 directory containing the pattern awk; the following command achieves that.

$ grep -lr awk Article2/


As we have seen so far, grep can be used only as a search utility and cannot be used to modify the file contents. Here is where the second utility sed comes in handy. sed is a stream editor used to apply text transformations. When we display the contents of Expenses.csv using the cat command (a command which displays the contents of one or more files without having to open the file for editing), the content may appear closely packed, making it difficult to view the contents. So, let's see how sed handles this in the following command.

$ sed -e 'i\ ' Expenses.csv


It will result in an empty line being added before each line of text, making it easy for the eye to view the contents.


One can obtain double spacing by using the following command.

$ sed -e 'i\\n' Expenses.csv

Now let's see how to highlight lines having a specific word. Suppose we want all Food related transactions to be underlined, issue the following command.

$ sed -e '/Food/a\t=====================' Expenses2.csv


Even more emphasis can be achieved by the following command

$ sed -e '/Food/a============'-e'/Food/i============' Expenses.csv


The following example shows how we can segregate transactions of a particular type, lets say those related to groceries. If we we want all grocery related purchases to be written to a separate file say Groceries.csv.




sed can also be used to perform string substitution. For example, if we want to change all the entries of 'Other' to 'Miscellaneous', it can be done as follows




So far, we have seen text processing capabilities of sed. It is now time to look into the awk utility, which is more potent because it is highly programmable. It provides programmable constructs like conditionals, looping, formatting, etc. In our earlier examples, the way text was displayed was not pleasing to the eye. We will now format the content such that its display is more aesthetic. The following awk command shows its formatting capabilities.



Now let us look at slightly more complex examples; let's say we want to list the various types of expense categories present in the file. To do this, we should focus on the fourth column, which indicates the transaction category. Additionally, we want only the unique values from this column. We can achieve it as follows. First, we fetch the contents of the fourth column, sort it and later eliminate duplicates using the uniq command.




Suppose we want to find the highest expenditure among all our transactions. This would require more instructions therefore, let us write it as a script named FetchMax.awk.




Next, let us find the total expenditure for the Merchandise category. The script file CategoryExpenses.awk is shown below.





We can improve the script much further by specifying the category during runtime, shown in CategoryExp2.awk. 



We have seen how the three utilities grep, sed and awk form a powerful triad that is essential for anyone dealing with text processing on large texts. sed is best for string processing, and awk is better at handling columnar data. These can be further combined together to achieve even more complex tasks. To sum it up, this troika of utilities is like a swiss knife in the armory of a data analyst. ","The article introduces three powerful text-processing command-line utilities—grep, sed, and awk—available in GNU Bash Shell (on GNU/Linux systems and Windows 10 via Ubuntu on Windows). These utilities help users efficiently track personal financial transactions in large, diverse datasets.

grep is used for searching text within files, counting occurrences, and finding files with specific patterns. For example, searching for transactions on an American Express card or counting pharmacy-related transactions.

sed is a stream editor used for text transformations like adding spacing for readability, highlighting specific text (e.g., food-related transactions), and performing string substitutions.

awk is more programmable, enabling formatted data display, processing specific columns, and writing scripts for tasks like finding maximum expenditures or calculating total expenses for a category.

Together, these utilities form a powerful toolkit for text processing, offering versatile solutions for parsing and analyzing large datasets.",Technology and Gadgets

Nadda backs Shivraj-Vishnu Dutt duo for Madhya Pradesh Assembly polls 2023,"Mr. Nadda is on his maiden visit which is being describe by many as formal beginning of election campaign to the State after taking over reins of the party in 2020
Amidst the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Madhya Pradesh entering the campaign mode for next year’s Assembly elections, the party’s national president J.P. Nadda has hinted that it is in no mood for a change of guard in the State and that Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan will be the face of the party in 2023.

Responding to a question on whether the 2023 elections would be fought under the leadership of the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-Vishnu Dutt Sharma (State BJP President), Mr. Nadda said “everything goes in that very direction”.

The BJP president was addressing a press conference at the party’s State headquarters on Wednesday, the first day of his two-day tour of the State with both Mr. Chouhan and Mr. Sharma sitting with him. This is Mr. Nadda’s first visit to Bhopal after taking over the reins of the party in January 2020. His visit is being described by many leaders as the formal beginning of the election campaign for the BJP in the State.

Drawing a botanical analogy, Mr. Nadda said that the leadership was akin to a plant and frequent questions around it “were like uprooting it repeatedly to check if it was firmly planted”.

“For the 2023 elections, the parliamentary board will decide the question of leadership but under Shivraj ji’s leadership, the government is doing a good job,” Mr. Nadda further said.

The statement comes at a time when there have been reports of differences between Mr. Chouhan and some of his Cabinet and party colleagues and also speculation over Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia assuming a bigger role in State politics following his move to an official bungalow in Bhopal in May.

Earlier, Mr. Nadda also hailed the State government for its development works and its performance in central schemes, adding that under BJP rule, States like Madhya Pradesh had uplifted the living standards of the people and shed the BIMARU– a popular acronym used for Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh in the last few decades–tag. He highlighted schemes like Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana and the Jal Jeevan Mission where Madhya Pradesh has been on the first and the second position respectively over the past two years.

Presenting a slew of statistics on the government’s achievements on many social and economic indicators, Mr. Nadda claimed that the Congress government that had ruled the State for a couple of years had stopped the welfare schemes and focused on a divisive agenda. “The Congress is synonymous with corruption and commission,” he said.

No tickets to kin of party leaders
Responding to a question on nepotism in the BJP, Mr. Nadda said that the party will refrain from giving tickets to family members of its MLAs or MPs for all upcoming elections – from the local bodies elections scheduled in a few days to Assembly elections next year and even beyond.

""At the time of the byelection, many Madhya Pradesh leaders had said that not giving tickets to the sons of leaders would cause problems. The State President and the Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had said that if the aspiring family members were denied tickets, there could be trouble but we said we would bear adverse consequences but won’t compromise on our principles,” Mr. Nadda said, citing similar examples from other States as well.","BJP President J.P. Nadda, on his first visit to Madhya Pradesh since taking charge in 2020, signaled that Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan would likely lead the party in the 2023 Assembly elections. During a press conference, Nadda praised the state's government for its performance in development and central schemes, asserting that Madhya Pradesh had shed its BIMARU tag. He also criticized the Congress for halting welfare schemes and focusing on corruption. Additionally, Nadda emphasized that BJP would not give election tickets to the family members of current leaders to avoid nepotism. His visit marks the formal start of BJP’s election campaign in the state.",Politics

The government plans to develop Rohini as an “abode of lakes and recreation” within 8 months.

A project revolving around the revival of lakes and water bodies in Delhi is on the AAP government’s list of priorities, the government stated, adding that it sought to bring the initiative to completion as soon as possible.

On Saturday, Mr. Jain directed the officials concerned to modify the structures so that the underground water recharge can be maximised using cost-effective methods and healthy ecological conditions can be maintained. 

A total of eight lakes will receive and recharge 68 MLD of treated water from the STP after polishing to a biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) 3 level, the government said.

The Delhi government’s ‘City of Lakes’ project has two focus areas: lakes and other water bodies. In the first phase of development, 250 water bodies and 23 lakes will be taken up by the government. The project aims at creating multiple water reservoirs to arrest urban flooding and avoid choked drains. 

The rejuvenation of lakes involves three components: construction of treatment plants, lakes and landscaping. The entire project is broadly based on sewage water remediation and lake development.

The Rohini Lake project is one of the 23 lakes to be revived in the Capital and it has also been designated as a key project by the Delhi government. The lake is situated in a complex of 100 acres of land where the Rohini STP occupies 20 acres, while lakes and green areas are being developed across 80 acres.

The wastewater will be treated in the STP with a capacity of 15 MGD and the treated effluent will be further polished using suitable treatment technologies, after which it will be released into the lake. 

The Rohini Lake project is expected to be completed in an eight-month time frame and will be commissioned within one month after completion, the government added.","Delhi Water Minister Satyendar Jain visited Rohini Lake to assess the progress of the Delhi government's ""City of Lakes"" project, aimed at reviving lakes and water bodies across the city.

54,The Hindu,01/04/2022,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-introduces-antarctica-bill-in-lok-sabha/article65281718.ece,Centre introduces Antarctica Bill in Lok Sabha,"The government on Friday introduced the ‘Antarctica Bill’ in the Lok Sabha that envisages regulating visits and activities to Antarctica as well potential disputes that may arise among those present on the continent. The Bill also prescribes penal provisions for certain serious violations.

The text of the Bill, which was introduced by Science Minister, Jitendra Singh, on Friday says that it seeks to “... prohibit Indian expedition to Antarctica or carrying of certain activities in Antarctica without a permit or the written authorisation of another party to the protocol…provide for inspection in India by an officer designated by the Central government as an Inspector and to constitute an inspection team to carry out inspections in Antarctica... .provide for the constitution of the fund to be called the Antarctic fund which shall be applied towards the welfare of Antarctic research work and protection of Antarctic environment…. provide for designated courts and their jurisdiction.”

Mr. Singh remarked in Parliament that India had been a signatory to the Antarctica Treaty since 1983 and that encumbered India to specify a set of laws governing portions of the continent where it had its research bases. “Antarctica is a no man’s land... It isn’t that India is making a law for a territory that doesn’t belong to it…. the question is if in the territory involving India’s research stations, some unlawful activity happens, how to check it? The Treaty made it mandatory for the 54 signatory countries to specify laws governing territories on which their stations are located. China has five, Russia has five, we have two,” said Mr. Singh.

India is also signatory to treaties such as the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources and the Commission for Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, both of which enjoin India to help preserve the pristine nature of the continent.

“There is growing concern over preserving the pristine Antarctic environment and ocean around Antarctica from exploitation of marine living resources and human presence in Antarctica... India organises regular Antarctic expeditions and many persons from India visit Antarctica every year as tourists. In the future, the private ship and aviation industry will also start operations and promote tourism and fishing in Antarctica, which needs to be regulated. The continuing and growing presence of Indian scientists in Antarctica warrants a domestic legislation on Antarctica consistent with its obligations as a member of the Antarctic Treaty. This is also in sync with the emergence of India as a global leader on important international fronts,” the text of the Bill notes.

Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury of the Congress demanded to know how India had the right to make laws with penal provisions in territory that didn’t belong to it and Saugata Roy of the Trinamool Congress also wanted to know, on similar lines, how India could enact Indian law in a ‘no man’s land’ and whether there would be a bureaucratic set up in place to govern matters concerning Antarctica. They both demanded that the Bill be passed to a Select or Standing Committee of Parliament for a deeper analysis.

M. Ravichandran, Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences told The Hindu that not only was India obliged to have such under obligations but it would also clearly establish that any illegal act or “crime” in Indian territory at Antarctica would mean that a person — even if they were a foreigner — would be subject to Indian laws. “This law also specifies that if there was an accident, or say an oil spill, to happen due to a ship in Antarctic territory, how accountability could be fixed. Currently there’s no system.” He added that a discussion on the Bill was expected in the House next week.

Following its first expedition to Antarctica in 1982, India has now established two standing research stations, Bharti and Maitri, at Antarctica. Both these places are permanently manned by researchers.","The Indian government introduced the ‘Antarctica Bill’ in the Lok Sabha to regulate activities in Antarctica, including requiring permits for expeditions and setting up an Antarctic Fund. The Bill also provides for inspections and the establishment of designated courts. It addresses the need for domestic laws to manage Indian research stations and protect the environment.

Minister Jitendra Singh emphasized that the Bill aligns with international treaties and ensures accountability for any incidents. Some Congress and Trinamool Congress members questioned the authority of the Bill and suggested a deeper parliamentary review. India has two research stations in Antarctica and has been involved in Antarctic research since 1982.",National News

The resolution is scheduled to be discussed at 3 p.m. on Friday, New York Time. Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council and also its president for this month, is certain to veto the resolution. India has abstained during UN votes on Russia and Ukraine in the recent past, as it attempts to balance its interests with both Moscow and the West, led by Washington.

Hours before the scheduled meeting on Friday, External Affairs Minister said via Twitter, that he had emphasized “diplomacy and dialogue” to resolve the crisis, during a conversation with Ukraine’s Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba.

“I emphasized that India supports diplomacy & dialogue as the way out. Discussed predicament of Indian nationals, including students. Appreciate his support for their safe return,” Mr Jaishankar said.

While India has called for diplomacy and dialogue, Russian troops have invaded Ukraine and entered Kyiv, as per reports. At Wednesday’s UNSC meeting – during which Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a ‘special operation’ in Ukraine, India’s permanent representative T S Tirumurti did not name Russia during his remarks.

Friday’s draft resolution condemns Russia’s aggression in the “strongest terms,” reaffirms the sovereignty of Ukraine and “requires the Russian Federation immediately, completely, and unconditionally to withdraw its forces,” a senior administration official of the U.S., who did not want to be named, told reporters on a briefing call on Thursday.

During a call with Mr. Jaishankar on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, “stressed the importance of a strong collective response to condemn Russia’s invasion and call for an immediate withdrawal and ceasefire,” during this call, the State Department’s spokesperson said.

Asked if India, a ‘Major Defense Partner’ of the U.S., was “in sync” with the U.S. on Russia, U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday that discussions were still on-going – possibly referring to talks around Friday’s resolution.","India has not committed to supporting a U.S.-backed UNSC resolution calling for Russia's withdrawal from Ukraine, scheduled for discussion on Friday.

Most of those admitted are the middle aged persons and senior citizens who refused to get vaccinated.

In the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, where 240 patients are under treatment, 70 are unvaccinated. All the patients in intensive care unit in the hospital have contracted the delta variant, said Dean E. Therani Rajan.

Of the 17 patients in the ICU, only two have taken both doses of the vaccine but in these people age and comorbidities were a factor, he said.

On why the remaining 15 were not vaccinated, the Dean said they were apprehensive of the comorbidities becoming worse. These patients had cardiac ailments, diabetes, hypertension and stroke. A centenarian who got infected had refused to get vaccinated, he said.

At the Stanley Medical College, 190 patients have been admitted. Of these, 12 are in the ICU and seven are fully vaccinated.

Three persons had taken one dose and only two persons were unvaccinated. Dean P. Balaji said the lower literacy level among the residents of the localities the hospital catered to had ensured greater focus from the government to get them vaccinated.

Persons who were admitted to the ICU had co-morbid conditions and had been transferred from private hospitals.

“They were found to have been infected while being taken for surgery,” he added.

At the Government Medical College Hospital, Omandurar Estate, which is a dedicated COVID care hospital, 141 persons have been admitted and 10 are in the ICU. “Eight of them are not vaccinated. As many as 20 are not on ventilator but on oxygen support. Of these, 10 are not vaccinated. Generally, it is only lethargy and fear arising from comorbidities,” said Dean R. Jayanthi.

As many as 115 COVID-19 patients have been admitted to the Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital, said Dean Santhimalar.","Hospitals in the city report fewer admissions despite a recent COVID-19 spike. Most admitted patients are unvaccinated middle-aged and senior citizens:

At least 40 private hospitals in the State have been pulled up for violations, including “charging exorbitant rates” for treating COVID-19 patients.

So far, 10 private hospitals have lost their permits to treat COVID-19 patients, following violations including charging patients in excess of the government stipulated rates for COVID-19 treatment.

Officials of the Directorate of Medical and Rural Health Services said though the number of complaints were not the same as during the first wave, a number of hospitals were in trouble for charging more than the cost prescribed by the State government.

“We have issued notices to 22 hospitals for violations, including excess charges for treatment. We have cancelled COVID-19 treatment permissions to 10 hospitals so far. They cannot admit new patients, while existing in-patients should be treated and discharged. The Directorate has been taking action under the Tamil Nadu Clinical Establishments Act,” an officer said.

On Friday, the Directorate issued notices to 20 more private hospitals for charging exorbitant rates. “We had received complaints through the State health helpline 104. If these hospitals do not initiate refunds, we will not only cancel their COVID-19 treatment permissions, but also their clinical registrations,” he said.

On May 22, the State government had issued an order fixing maximum rates that private hospitals could charge patients for COVID-19 treatment. For those covered under the Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme, it had fixed ₹5,000 a day for patients not requiring oxygen support, and ₹15,000 for those requiring oxygen support. For critical cases, it fixed ₹35,000 for ICU with ventilatory support, ₹30,000 for ICU with non-invasive ventilation and ₹25,000 for ICU with oxygen as stepping down.

For the general public, the State government fixed the cost of treatment on a par with CMCHIS — ₹5,000 a day for A3 to A6 category hospitals and ₹7,500 a day for A1 and A2 category hospitals for non-oxygen beds. It had fixed ₹15,000 for oxygen-supported beds and Rs. 35,000 for ICU with ventilatory support. Hospitals were permitted to charge ₹30,000 a day for non-invasive ventilator, C-PAP and Bi-PAP in the ICU and ₹25,000 for ICU with oxygen as stepping down.

As per the government order, hospitals could face action under the Clinical Establishments Act and the Disaster Management Act if the charges are proven.

The bridge, located in front of the Theppakadu Reception Centre, was said to be weak, and needed to be replaced for the last nine years, said officials from the State Highways Department. However, as a wider bridge would have required the approval of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF), a decision was taken to replace the existing one with a structure of the same proportion, the officials said.

Conservationists have for years opposed widening the bridge as the current width, measuring a little over 4 metres, ensures that heavy vehicles from Gudalur, Kerala and Karnataka are not able to pass through the section and into the core area of the tiger reserve between Theppakadu and Masinagudi. This meant that vehicles travelling to Gudalur and Karnataka from Udhagamandalam too do not usually pass through the tiger reserve, but are forced to taking the longer route via Gudalur.

When contacted, Field Director of MTR, K.K. Kaushal, said permission had been granted by the Chief Wildlife Warden on condition that the bridge should not exceed the current dimensions. “As there is no transfer of land taking place, the permission from the MoEF is not required,” he said.

Forest Department officials said discussions were held with the Divisional Engineer of the State Highways Department A.S. Viswanathan to come up with a plan to find a detour bypassing the bridge during its construction. “An existing path in the area will be paved and traffic will be diverted till the work on the bridge is completed. The highways has handed over ₹ 25 lakh to the Forest Department for the work to be completed,” an official said. The entire project is estimated to cost ₹ 2 crore, officials said.

The stretch of the Moyar where the bridge is to be rebuilt is famous for sightings of marsh crocodiles and smooth-coated otters. Mr. Kaushal said all efforts would be taken to ensure that the development works would not have an impact on the riverine ecosystem of the tiger reserve.","The iron girder bridge over the Moyar River in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve is set to be replaced due to its weakened state and narrow width. The existing bridge, which is just over 4 meters wide, limits heavy vehicle traffic, helping to reduce disruptions to the tiger reserve. Conservationists have long opposed widening it, as the narrow width prevents large vehicles from entering sensitive areas of the reserve.

State Highways officials noted that while a wider bridge would have required approval from the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF), the new bridge will maintain the same dimensions. This decision avoids the need for MoEF approval and minimizes environmental impact.

Construction plans include paving an existing path to divert traffic during the bridge's replacement, which will be funded with ₹25 lakh from the Highways Department as part of a ₹2 crore project. Efforts will be made to protect the Moyar River's ecosystem, known for its crocodiles and otters.",Infrastructure Development

The Deputy Conservator of Forests, Bengaluru Urban, has issued a public notice about the project, which states that of the 190 trees that are there in the project area, 43 will have to be removed, of which 28 can be transplanted.

The ₹20-crore project announced in February 2020, which will be carried out by Bengaluru Smart City Ltd., will have a well-equipped auditorium and lecture halls over a total built-up area of 40,350 sq. ft.

Pramod G. Galgali, Director of the planetarium, told The Hindu that the project, which was brought to a standstill by the COVID-19 pandemic, is aimed at providing necessary infrastructure to the non-formal science education activities of the planetarium.

“We have been organising non-formal science education activities since two decades. The science lectures are becoming popular. But we did not have the necessary infrastructure, and hence requested the government. The new building will house a 600-seater auditorium and some classrooms as well,” he said.

The proposed building will also have a viewing deck for events/eclipses, restrooms and toilets, apart from a small café with seating and basement parking. “We will accommodate what we can inside. The experts will decide on the details,” he said.

Citizens are not entirely enthused. Sandeep Anirudhan, convener of Citizen’s Agenda of Bengaluru, a citizen’s movement, said, “Public consultation is mandated by EIA, but they have to give drawings, survey of the place and other details. How is the public going to make objections without all these?” He also said that there should not be any plans involving loss of green cover. “We've destroyed the city enough. Transplantation success rate is only 10%. They should be thinking of designing a project around the trees,” he said.

Weekend draw
Since reopening mid-November, the planetarium, a popular landmark in the city and a big draw for science enthusiasts and children, has been running regular shows. “The number of visitors is much lower than before, but people are coming. Measures have been taken as per the SOPs, including temperature checks, sanitising, etc. The sky theatre is running at 60% capacity due to alternative seating. In the existing capacity, the weekends are full. On some weekends, we had to give additional shows,” Mr. Galgali said.","A total of 43 trees will be removed for the ₹20-crore smart upgrade of the Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium in Bengaluru. Of these, 28 trees are slated for transplantation. The project, stalled by the pandemic, includes a 600-seat auditorium and classrooms for science education. Concerns have been raised by citizens about the environmental impact and the low success rate of tree transplantation, urging the design to preserve more green cover.",Environment

Relations between Washington and Beijing are at their worst in years over a series of flashpoints including trade, technology and human rights.

The text put forward by the Senators from across Washington’s political divide alleged China was guilty of a campaign “against Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and members of other Muslim minority groups” that “constitutes genocide”.

Further fuelling the criticism, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Indian news site The Print on Tuesday that China’s actions in Xinjiang “remind us of what happened in the 1930s in Germany”.

Beijing angrily hit back on Wednesday, saying the “so-called genocide in Xinjiang is a rumour deliberately concocted by some anti-China forces”.

The sensitive region is tightly controlled by Chinese authorities, and rights groups say more than one million Uighurs have been detained in camps.

“The U.S. Senators you mentioned have always been anti-China and are keen to concoct all kinds of lies to discredit China and use them to seek their own political gains,” Foreign Spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters.

Mr. Wang also turned the tables on China’s critics, attacking the U.S. for the “assimilation and massacres of Native Americans in history to greatly reduce their population.”

“We urge certain US politicians to respect the facts, stop fabricating lies, and stop using Xinjiang-related issues to interfere in China's internal affairs,” he said.","China on Wednesday accused U.S. Senators of spreading ""all kinds of lies"" following a resolution put forward by U.S. lawmakers accusing Beijing of committing genocide against Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang.

Congress leader and national spokesperson Anant Gadgil blamed the BJP-led government at the Centre and the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), which is controlled by the BJP, for failing to check the spread of the contagion.

BJP MLA Siddharth Shirole hit back saying that it was the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government’s responsibility to ensure that the mega facilities and other COVID-19 hospitals are properly managed. Mr. Gadgil, a former MLC, said that despite Pune having a BJP MP (Girish Bapat), five BJP MLAs, and 100 BJP corporators dominating the PMC, the situation seemed to be spiralling out of control.



‘Centre kept airports open’
Attacking the Narendra Modi government, the Congressman questioned why the Centre did not shut down international airports across the country, especially in Mumbai, in January.

“When most southeast Asian nations like Vietnam and Singapore and countries in the Asia-Pacific region like New Zealand, had already shut down their airports in January realising the danger, then why didn’t New Delhi do the same? Why did the Modi government go ahead with its ‘Namaste Trump’ pageant in Ahmedabad which further aided in spreading the virus in Gujarat and neighbouring areas, with the influx of thousands of foreigners?” he asked.

Mr. Gadgil alleged that between March 1 and 15, nearly 10 lakh international passengers had landed at Mumbai international airport of whom barely 19% were screened.

“Had the Centre closed down airports and cancelled hosting U.S. President Donald Trump in Gujarat, the virus would not have spread in Mumbai, and Pune, too, would have been safe today,” the Congressman claimed.

Mr. Gadgil was one of the first elected representatives in the State to channelise his MLA fund for boosting the public healthcare infrastructure at hospitals in Mumbai and Pune.

“Early on, I had raised the matter in the State Legislature that the MLA fund be increased to ₹50 lakh for COVID-19 related purchases. I would like to know how many elected representatives from the BJP have spent for bolstering medical infrastructure in Pune when the virus was just beginning to spread in the city?” he said.

As per State Health Department figures, Pune district, which has exceeded even Delhi’s figures, has nearly two lakh reported cases at present. Of them, around 34,000 are active ones with 4,400 fatalities.



Responding to Mr. Gadgil, Mr. Shirole, the BJP legislator from Shivajinagar, said that the PMC had already spent ₹300 crore to set up the jumbo COVID-19 facilities and that it was the ruling MVA government’s [of which the Congress is part] responsibility to ensure that they were run satisfactorily.

“It is the State leadership and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray who ought to personally intervene and hold accountable those responsible for the mismanagement of the COVID-19 hospitals in Pune. Mr. Thackeray and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar must closely monitor the situation, review the infrastructure and state of equipment, and urgently increase the number of experienced medical staff and doctors to man these hospitals,” Mr. Shirole said.

The stream of complaints regarding the poor management of the jumbo facilities has divided the Pune civic body administration and the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA), with the former blaming the latter for failing to maintain the facilities.

The mega COVID-19 facility at the city’s College of Engineering Pune (CoEP) grounds, which became operational recently, has received flak from citizens and politicos, with complaints being directed at the insensitivity shown by the management of the facility.

Meanwhile, Rubal Agarwal, additional municipal commissioner, and executive head of the jumbo centre, said the PMC had decided to provide manpower to ensure that the facility was smoothly operated.

‘Doctors did not quit’
“A staff of 50 doctors and 120 paramedics will be serving at the CoEP facility. There have been rumours that doctors and nurses at this facility have resigned. But there is no truth in this,” Ms. Agarwal clarified. She said that two cardiac ambulances had been made available there, while stressing that all treatment — including provision of remdisivir injections — would be free of charge.","Pune’s COVID-19 crisis has sparked a political clash between Congress and BJP. Congress leader Anant Gadgil blamed the BJP-led Central government and Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) for failing to manage the pandemic, particularly criticizing their handling of airport shutdowns and a high-profile event.

It’s clear the match being staged at the Ageas Bowl in Southampton is about much more than just cricket.

A smoothly run test series, played in a strict isolated environment featuring repeated COVID-19 testing and social distancing, can lay the blueprint for future matches and tours in cricket but also events in other sports targeting a resumption.

“If you get one thing wrong, it might blow this whole ‘getting sport back onto the radar’ further back,” England stand-in captain Ben Stokes said on Tuesday in his eve-of-game news conference.

Stokes also spoke about the “responsibility on our shoulders” to deliver a “massive occasion” for TV viewers who have been without international cricket for four months.

“I know everyone has been craving this from a player’s point of view,” he said, “but also I think from a spectator’s and fan’s point of view.”

And then there’s the message England and the West Indies players want to send about equality in sport and society in general in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement.

A BLM logo will be on the collar of the test shirts worn by players from both teams and there is set to be a “gesture” made by the teams before the game.

West Indies players have said the movement is a source of motivation on this tour.

“Not only has this been a period for us getting ready for a test match,” Stokes said, “it has also been great for us to have educational chats as a team around this and it has been really beneficial for a lot of our members.

“I feel as a team we have an opportunity to send a real powerful message and I am really excited as an individual, and the team is really excited, that we are able to be a part of that.”

Cricket’s oldest format kicks off a very new era for the sport. One where there are no spectators at matches, one-way systems inside venues to maintain distancing, twice-weekly testing for coronavirus, and players not allowed out of their hotels.

Players from the two teams will come into vaguely close contact with each other only on the field of play.

TV viewers will have the choice of adding a so-called “Lord’s hum” during coverage, but there will be no artificial crowd noise in the ground or music between overs, ensuring an eerie silence once the match begins except for selective announcements over the public address system about things such as milestones or bowling changes.

The big screens around the venue will show key highlights, DRS and sponsor messages.

The West Indies squad has been here since June 9 in order that the players could first quarantine at Manchester’s Old Trafford ground and then practise there in lockdown conditions. They had two intra-squad matches - England has had only one - before the squad travelled to Southampton for the match.

“We’re about to show that other places can start putting things together,” West Indies coach Phil Simmons said. “The England and Wales Cricket Board have to be commended for all the work they have done to get the series on the road and let’s see what other countries take from it.”

Simmons has had to self-isolate in his hotel room for a period after leaving camp to attend his father-in-law’s funeral last week.

England’s buildup has been interrupted, too, by captain Joe Root having to leave camp to be at the birth of his second child. He will not feature in the first of three tests, meaning Stokes has the captaincy for the first time.

“I haven’t had much advice but there has been a lot of opinions flying around,” Stokes said. “The best message that I have received was when I got my photos done yesterday in the blazer. Rooty just left a message on the hanger which said- ‘Do it your way.’”

The West Indies has not won a test series in England since 1988 but the team is the holder of the Wisden Trophy after a 2-1 victory in the Caribbean last year.

The other two tests take place in Manchester, starting July 16 and 24.","International cricket resumes in Britain with England facing the West Indies at the Ageas Bowl, Southampton, marking the first test match since March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This series, conducted under strict health protocols, aims to set a precedent for future sports events.

The match will be played without spectators, featuring enhanced safety measures and a muted atmosphere.

These five Ts are testing, tracing, treatment, teamwork and tracking-monitoring.

“All the nations which remained a step ahead of COVID-19 have managed to control it. I have been in touch with various experts and doctors and we have formulated a five-point plan to deal with the situation in Delhi,” the Chief Minister said.

The first T is testing, which when done on a mas scale enables the actual data of people affected by novel coronavirus. “Like South Korea, we will be testing on a large scale. We have ordered testing for around 50,000 people and rapid testing rounds for 1 lakh people which will begin from Friday,” he said.

Through rapid testing, the government will also be able to identify COVID-19 hotspots and take necessary action, said Mr. Kejriwal.

The second T is tracing, which involves identifying and quarantining people who have come in contact with infected persons. “We are taking the help of police to trace whether the people who have been advised to self-quarantine are actually doing it or not. For this, we have given 27,702 contact numbers to the police through which they are tracing their movement,” he said.

The third component, he said, is treatment. The LNJP and GB Pant hospitals had been declared primary hospitals for COVID-19 treatment with 1,500 and 500 beds respectively, and no other treatments are being carried out there. While the Rajiv Gandhi hospital has 450 beds, 2,450 bedsare available in government hospitals and 450 beds at private ones.

“Serious patients who are suffering from heart diseases and patients above 50 years will be isolated in hospitals and the rest with minor symptoms will be kept in isolation in hotels and dharamshalas,” he said.

The fourth element of the five-point plan i s teamwork and collective efforts are being made to fight the virus. All State governments, he said, must learn from each other and work together.

The fifth T, he said, is tracking and monitoring. “It is my responsibility to ensure that all these measures are in place and all the systems are functioning smoothly. I am tracking and monitoring all these things 24x7,” he said.","Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal unveiled a “5T plan” to combat COVID-19, focusing on Testing, Tracing, Treatment, Teamwork, and Tracking-Monitoring.

Lakshminarayanaswamy, Managing Trustee of SNR Sons Charitable Trust. We are at the newly inaugurated turf wicket cricket grounds of Coimbatore District Cricket Association at Sri Ramakrishna College of Arts and Sciences.

The facility, approved by the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association and the BCCI, will host the upcoming edition of the Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL) matches, a first for Coimbatore. The ground has five centre wickets and a 73-metre boundary line as per international standards. The ground with G2 Bermuda grass is maintained with treated water from the institutions. “It needs a lot of watering. We wanted to ensure that we don’t use up the ground water, not even a drop of it,” he says.

There is a pavilion for the teams, rooms for umpires, third umpires, match referees, and other officials. A temporary pavilion for nearly 10, 000 spectators is coming up. Work is progressing at a good pace to ready the ground in time for the TNPL.


The Tamil Nadu Cricket Association is keen to develop cricket outside Chennai, says Lakshminarayanaswamy adding that the TNPL inauguration ceremony will be held here. The first seven matches are scheduled to be played here. The flood lights, camera stands, and so on are getting ready. “We have prepared sporting wickets and three board matches have already been played here,” he says. There was rain during one of the matches and to the relief of the organisers, the water completely drained out as the rainwater harvesting systems are in place.


The matches were held after the BCCI cleared the ground as being suitable. A little away is the nets complex with six turf wickets. “This will ensure that even while a match is going on, other teams can have their practice sessions. The complex is used by over 50 youngsters every day for training. The space is also used for selections of district teams (from under-14 to senior categories).”

Former Indian wicket keeper, Kiran More has given a positive feedback to the facility. He was here recently to select teams for Gulf Oil. “Kiran More selected 15 members from a crowd of 600. After the selection, he commented that it is one of the finest facilities he has seen in the country,” he says.

More on CDCA
Coimbatore District Cricket Association (CDCA) was founded in 1958 by G. K. Sundaram and R. Krishnaswamy. It has seen tremendous transformation over the years. It is one of the district associations in the State to hold league matches from June to March
Recalling his 25-year association with CDCA, Lakshminarayanaswamy says top players like Sachin Tendulkar , Kapil Dev, Manoj Prabhakar and Srikanth have played zonal matches in Coimbatore in the 90s. “ Now, they are eager to come and have a look at our facility.”
Every year, CDCA conducts camps, league matches and as many as 10 tournaments for all age categories. They have exclusive tournaments in which over 40 schools participate. They also provide coaching support
CDCA conducts six division league matches. There are 10 teams in each division which makes it 60 clubs. Over 3000 people are actively playing the sport in the district. To know more, call: 63809-43877 or e-mail: cricketcdca@gmail.com
Lakshminarayanaswamy who is also the president of the Coimbatore District Cricket Association says they want to see more cricket here in the coming years. Board matches, Ranji trophy... are all on the anvil. “We want to give a fillip to women’s cricket. We already have about 15 to 20 girls, mostly from the neighbouring schools, who train here at the nets regularly. Our vision is to create a woman’s cricket league. With the Indian women's team doing well abroad, girls are inspired. We identify and coach talent in a scientific manner.”


It took them six months of intense work to develop the facility. “N. Srinivasan, former ICC Chairman inaugurated it and the first question he asked was if we could host an IPL match here. We want to have one IPL match every year. As the space is within the city, it is easy for the crowds.” Lakshminarayanaswamy likens the maintenance of the ground to raising a child. He says the ground requires constant care.

Many industrialists from Coimbatore chipped in with funds. “Other sporting associations should tap into CSRs and get funds to host sporting events. Also, develop infrastructure as it is important to prepare the students for the national and state level. There is enough and more opportunities in sport, be it table tennis, shuttle, badminton, hockey, football or kabaddi. We want to work on it.”

Public support is important, he insists. “We are looking forward to the TNPL matches. We want the people to have a good time. Parents are keen now to encourage their children in sports. Students should continue playing sports, beyond their college days to keep themselves fit. There is a career in sports too. Not just in playing, but also in sports management, coaching...”","Coimbatore's newly inaugurated cricket ground at Sri Ramakrishna College of Arts and Sciences is set to host Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL) matches for the first time.

The performance looks at the female performer’s body as a site of protest.

The play, a powerful one-woman physical theatre, performed at the International Theatre Festival of Kerala (ITFoK) on Saturday, draws from the lives of urban characters who speak similar languages of consumerism and technology.

Daily annoyances
It deals with daily annoyances of being a woman in the country.

Masculinity in South Asia, especially India, is asserted and celebrated widely, says Deepika. “Its conventional manifestations are varied and dangerous, infecting different aspects of everyday life. Whether through the perpetration of rape culture in cinema and politics, or the palpable anxiety of the female body on the street, masculinity occupies oppressively large spaces, literally and figuratively,” she says.

Subverting masculinity
No Rest in the Kingdom has been created out of the desire to embody and subvert expressions of this masculinity through the body of a female performer, she says.

The kingdom is the current society where we live, where women are subjected to daily discrimination and violence.

Blurring the boundaries of genders, the actor embodies a variety of characters — male, female and feline — representing a gender and inter-species fluidity. The cat is a powerful motif that runs through the play.

How might her body, alone and vulnerable, serve as a metaphor for gender insensitivity and antagonism? How can her body transform into multiple sites of protest and how can humour, irreverence, and playfulness become her primary weapons of dissent and opposition?

This show has travelled to find resonance in different countries because its characters are archetypes of ‘masculinity’ familiar across cultures.

The play causes discomfort, sometimes scepticism. It breeds introspection and provokes conversations, Deepika says.

She avoids clichés, does not preach. But the play holds a mirror to the audience.

The characters she portrays sent the audience to howls of laughter.

But for every woman in the audience, there were scenes that they can identify deeply with. The play is produced by Sandbox Collective.","No Rest in the Kingdom, a one-woman black comedy by Deepika Arwind, explores how women confront everyday misogyny in society. Performed at the International Theatre Festival of Kerala, the play uses physical theatre to portray urban characters navigating consumerism and technology. It subverts traditional masculinity through humor and the female body as a protest tool. The performance blurs gender boundaries, using various archetypes to provoke introspection and challenge gender norms, resonating across cultures.",Opinion and Editorial

She had declared in a questionnaire at check-in that she was not pregnant but airline staff nevertheless requested she undergo a “fit-to-fly” assessment designed for women with a body size or shape resembling a pregnant woman.

The test result came up negative.

“It was very humiliating and frustrating,” Nishida told the Wall Street Journal.

She grew up on Saipan and her family have lived on the island for more than 20 years.

The airline apologised to Nishida and said the practice had been discontinued when contacted by AFP. We have immediately suspended the practice while we review it. We’d like to apologise for the distress caused,” the airline said in a statement.

Hong Kong Express said it had taken “action on flights to Saipan from February 2019 to help ensure US immigration laws were not being undermined”, in response to concerns raised by the island’s authorities.

“We recognise the significant concerns this practice has caused,” it said.

Saipan is a popular destination for women wanting to give birth on US soil to secure American citizenship for their child.

OpenAI's new financing round is expected to come in the form of convertible notes, according to sources with direct knowledge of the matter, who said its $150 billion valuation will be contingent on whether the ChatGPT-maker can upend its corporate structure and remove a profit cap for investors.

The details of the conditions of the $6.5 billion funding, which have not been previously reported, show how far OpenAI, the most valuable AI startup in the world, has come from a research-based non-profit, and the structural changes it's willing to make to attract ever more investment to fund its expensive pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI), or AI that surpasses human intelligence.

The outsized funding round has seen strong investor demand and could be finalized in the next two weeks, given the rapid growth of OpenAI's revenue, sources added.

Existing investors such as Thrive Capital, Khosla Ventures, as well as Microsoft are expected to participate. New investors including Nvidia and Apple also plan to invest. Sequoia Capital is also in talks to come back as a returning investor.

If the restructuring is unsuccessful, OpenAI would need to renegotiate its valuation with investors at which their shares will be converted, likely at a lower number, sources told Reuters, who requested anonymity to discuss private matters.","OpenAI is raising $6.5 billion in a new financing round, valuing the company at $150 billion.

Excess body weight, especially abdominal obesity, is associated with several health problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease. Various weight reduction methods have been tried over the years, most have not stood the test of time.
Recently, a class of drugs called GLP-1 agonists, originally used for diabetes, has gained attention for its role in weight loss. These drugs mimic the gut hormone GLP-1, which enhances insulin release and slows digestion, promoting a sense of fullness. Among these drugs, semaglutide has been in use for diabetes since 2017. In higher doses, it is now used as a weight-loss drug in Western countries.

YK Dhiren of UPF is the new president of UCM while Khuraijam Athouba of IPSA and Shanta Nahakpam of ACOAM-Lup are now the vice president and secretary general respectively of the Committee.
At the ceremony, YK Dhiren said that the turmoil which the State has been witnessing is the handiwork of the Government of India (GoI).
He claimed that GoI has been using Kuki narco terrorists to  implement their divide and rule policy in the State and create disunity among the people.
Facing the sinister design of the GoI won't be possible without people's uprising, Dhiren said.
It is doubtful that the GoI will work neutrally to end the conflict, he said while urging the people to get ready for another uprising.
Claiming that the GoI has been scheming to drive a wedge among the people since Manipur, an erstwhile kingdom, merged with India, Dhiren maintained that only unity among the people of Manipur can defy all designs to disturb the unity and integrity of the State.
Manipur is still intact because the people of Manipur have been resisting the plot of GoI to break the State apart whenever the situation demands, he said, adding that people should be aware of the motive of GoI.
Saying that UCM was formed following a people's uprising in 2021 to protect the  unity and integrity of Manipur, Dhiren maintained that UCM will continue to work on building a united  Manipur.
He also said that what UCM aspires is peaceful coexistence among the people of Manipur and not fostering enmity.
The primary mission of UCM is safeguarding Manipur and her people from forces which want to disintegrate the State, Dhiren said.

He stressed that only through a united front can the people of Manipur resist such efforts.
